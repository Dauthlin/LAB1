##This is version 1 of initial mmp.c program. 

You can run 
$ ./getperf.sh to plot the execution time result of the mmp.c 

Please note that before running getperf script, 

compile mmp.c

$ gcc mmp.c -o mmp


open mmp.c and getperf to see what this program and script is doing and think how you can change the program to improve the performance.

Next task (with sync) with our lecture 4 of SYS2, create new process using fork command in this mmp.c and investigate how new fork works and how much each fork command has impact on kernel execution time and total time.

Understand what is needed to optimise this program.

And discuss with your group members.
